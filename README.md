# Note

These programs were created with reference to the following repository.

https://github.com/utiasDSL/gym-pybullet-drones

I created this repository for my own learning.  
Unlike the referenced repository, the `OpenAI Gym` environment is not applicable.
 This is just a program to simulate the physical behavior of drones with `pybullet`.


Requires `Python>=3.7`.
