# Note

This repository was created with reference to the following repository.

https://github.com/utiasDSL/gym-pybullet-drones


Unlike the referenced repository, the `OpenAI Gym` environment is not applicable.
This is just a program to simulate the physical behavior of drones with `pybullet`.

I'm working on it now ...
